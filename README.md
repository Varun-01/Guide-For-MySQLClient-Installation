# Guide-For-MySQLClient-Installation
This repository contains a doc file with instructions to install MySQL and MySQLClient packages on your Mac. I personally ran into a lot of trouble while trying to setup the Pycharm IDE with MySQLClient for a project. Therefore, I decided to document the steps to correctly install the packages on your system.
Open the file named "MySQL and MySQLClient Guide Mac" and follow the eight steps mentioned there and you should be able to install the packages without any difficulties.
